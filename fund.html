<p class="margin">&emsp;A prayer of Biodiversity of Prince Philip, duke of Edinburgh and president emeritus of the Worldwide Fund for Nature. </p>

<p id="prayer">"Lord, the Creator of universe and author of the laws of nature, inspire in us thy servants the will to ensure the survival of all the species of animals and plants, which You have given to share this planet with us. Help us to understand that we have a responsibility for them and that "having dominion" does not mean that You have given us the right to exploit the living world. <br>Through Him who taught us that Solomon in all his glory could not compare with the beauty of all the flowers on the field. </p>

<p id="ps">Private organizations rely on income from donations to fund services.<br><br>When we donate to a charitable organization, we help make the difference we're unable to provide with our own hands.<br><br>Click on the organizations to know more.</p>
